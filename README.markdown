**RopeMate.tmbundle**
===========================

Brings Eclipse Java completion powers to TextMate by integrating with [Eclim](http://eclim.org/).

Eclim adds a server component to Eclipse that makes a lot of it's IDE features 
available to the outside. Eclim was created to integrate Vim and Eclipse, but the Eclipse plugin can
in principle support other editors as well.
